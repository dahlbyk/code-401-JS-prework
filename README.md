# Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript

### Pre-work

This is mandatory pre-work for Code 401: JavaScript that counts as 5% of your total course grade. When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this prework and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it. Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks.

##### NOTE: If you have previously taken a Code Fellows course, skip to #2.
